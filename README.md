# The Object of Your Affection (C++)
A simulated match-making service profile generator that takes in parameters for a profile, then allows the user to access and add to profile parameters.
The "app.cpp" already has an instantiated profile for our user, "sam". 
In our main function, we have the instantiated profile, then some hobbies added to said profile.
At the end, we print the profile information to the console.
